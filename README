This is where I'm tracking my finished, unpolished, or completely broken apps for finding solutions to
the problems at http://projecteuler.net. For now, it's a learning exercise in ruby, and a 
way of relearning myself some maths. Shit will probably look stupid. 

note: the eratosthenes and euler sieves are in 003 and 007, respectively.

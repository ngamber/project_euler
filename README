This is where I'm tracking my finished, unpolished, or completely broken apps for finding solutions to
the problems at http://projecteuler.net. For now, it's a learning exercise in ruby, and a 
way of relearning myself some maths. Shit will probably look stupid. 

As a note to myself: the useful shit that should probably be broken out into a reusable library of functions 
is mainly in 3.rb, for now.
